      "At Exavalu, I worked as a Software Engineer Trainee on the PSA Collectors platform, a web application for managing and trading collectible items. Using React and JavaScript, I fixed critical pre-production bugs, automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub workflows and Gen AI tools, and improved code quality—reducing manual testing by 95% and enhancing platform stability. I led KT sessions, mentored interns, and conducted cross-team demos, boosting collaboration and onboarding efficiency. On the 'My Collection' filter section, I eliminated all bugs, ensuring a seamless user experience and improving user retention and data collection. For PSA Offers and eBay Offers, I optimized logic to deliver user-specific collectible offers and streamlined backend payment processing, increasing revenue and customer satisfaction. I also resolved authentication performance issues, improved grading bot processes, and collaborated with cross-functional teams on the grading system, ensuring accurate customer role management and smooth testing.",
